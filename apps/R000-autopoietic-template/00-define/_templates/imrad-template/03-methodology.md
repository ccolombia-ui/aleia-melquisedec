# Methodology

## Research Design

[Describe the overall approach. Is this a qualitative synthesis? Comparative analysis? Pattern identification? Explain the research paradigm.]

## Data Sources

### Primary Sources
- **Atomics**: Received from HYPATIA (workbook: `wb-academic-research-[topic]`)
  - Number of atomics: [X]
  - Topics covered: [List]
- **Literature**: Academic papers, books, frameworks
  - Sources: [List key sources]
- **Existing Frameworks**: [List relevant frameworks]

### Secondary Sources
- **Documentation**: [Technical docs, specifications]
- **Expert Knowledge**: [Interviews, consultations if applicable]

## Data Collection Process

1. **Step 1**: [How data was gathered]
2. **Step 2**: [How data was organized]
3. **Step 3**: [How data was validated]

## Analysis Approach

### Thematic Analysis
- **Coding Process**: [How themes were identified]
- **Pattern Matching**: [How patterns were recognized]
- **Cross-Validation**: [How findings were verified]

### Synthesis Methodology
1. **Atomic Integration**: Combine atomics from HYPATIA
2. **Pattern Identification**: Identify recurring themes
3. **Conceptual Mapping**: Create relationships between concepts
4. **Validation**: Verify against literature and frameworks

## Tools & Techniques

- **Analysis Tools**: [Software, methods, frameworks used]
- **Visualization**: [Diagrams, mind maps, concept maps]
- **Validation Methods**: [How accuracy was ensured]

## Quality Assurance

- **Triangulation**: Cross-checking data from multiple sources
- **Peer Review**: Validation by MORPHEUS
- **Consistency Checks**: Ensuring coherence across findings

## Limitations

- **Limitation 1**: [Methodological constraint]
- **Limitation 2**: [Data availability issue]
- **Limitation 3**: [Scope restriction]
