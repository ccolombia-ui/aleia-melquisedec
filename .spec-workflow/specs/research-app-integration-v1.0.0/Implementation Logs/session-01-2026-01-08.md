# Session 01: Spec Creation - 2026-01-08

## Session Info
- **Date**: 2026-01-08
- **Duration**: ~2 hours
- **Phase**: Spec Creation (Meta)
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

---

## Objectives
1. ✅ Analyze user request with complex thinking
2. ✅ Create complete spec structure (requirements, design, tasks)
3. ✅ Setup folder structure for implementation
4. ⏳ Await keter information from user

---

## Work Done

### 1. Complex Thinking Analysis (Sequential Thinking MCP)
Applied 12-dimensional analysis to understand the architectural question:

**Key Insights**:
- **Framework vs Implementation**: melquisedec = framework, apps should be separate
- **Repository Strategy**: Each investigation = independent repo, not branch
- **apps/ Paradox**: Currently confusing, needs clarification
- **Package Evolution**: Research → Mature → Package → Standalone
- **Multi-Repo Coordination**: spec-workflow can manage cross-repo work

**Conclusion**: Clear separation needed with guidelines for future decisions.

### 2. Created Spec Documents

#### [README.md](../README.md)
- Executive summary with status badges
- Quick start for both user and AI agent
- Metrics and success criteria
- Tags and links

#### [requirements.md](../requirements.md)
- 7 functional requirements (REQ-1 to REQ-7)
- 5 user stories mapped to requirements
- Non-functional requirements (scalability, clarity, maintainability)
- Success criteria and out-of-scope boundaries
- Dependencies and priority phasing

**Key Requirements**:
- REQ-1: Keter analysis (structure, dependencies, maturity)
- REQ-2: ADR-002 Multi-Repository Strategy
- REQ-3: Decision tree for component placement
- REQ-4: Clarify apps/ purpose in melquisedec
- REQ-5: Template for new research repos
- REQ-6: Multi-repo spec workflow guidelines
- REQ-7: Final decision on keter placement

#### [design.md](../design.md)
- Architecture philosophy (separation, modularity, autonomy)
- System context diagram (Mermaid)
- Component design for each REQ
- Decision tree algorithm (Python pseudo-code)
- Keter analysis framework (scorecard methodology)
- ADR-002 structure and template
- apps/ clarification strategy (3 options)
- New repo template structure
- Multi-repo tracking conventions
- Data structures (ComponentMetadata, PlacementDecision)
- API design (CLI + Python API for future tooling)
- Testing strategy
- Risk analysis with mitigations
- Future enhancements (v2.0.0+)

#### [tasks.md](../tasks.md)
- 18 tasks organized in 5 phases + 2 meta-tasks
- Dependency graph (Mermaid)
- Acceptance criteria for each task
- Time estimates (~7.5 hours total)
- Execution strategy (4 sprints)
- Success metrics

**Task Organization**:
- Phase 1: Discovery (keter analysis)
- Phase 2: Documentation (ADR, guidelines, template)
- Phase 3: Cleanup (apps/ clarification, architecture update)
- Phase 4: Finalization (keter decision, roadmap)
- Phase 5: Validation (self-check, changelog, completion report)

```

## Decisions Made

### Decision: Spec Structure
- **Choice**: Full spec with requirements/design/tasks separation
- **Rationale**: Complex architectural decision needs thorough documentation
- **Alternative Rejected**: Simple markdown doc (insufficient for this scope)

### Decision: Multi-Repo Acknowledgment
- **Choice**: Acknowledge keter is external but create process to analyze it
- **Rationale**: Can't access directly, but can define methodology
- **Implementation**: User provides info via terminal commands

### Decision: Phased Approach
- **Choice**: 4 phases (Discovery → Documentation → Cleanup → Finalization)
- **Rationale**: Logical flow: understand → decide → document → implement
- **Benefit**: Clear milestones, manageable sessions

---

## Blockers & Risks

### 🚧 Blocker: Keter Access
- **Issue**: C:\proyectos\aleia-bereshit\apps\keter outside workspace
- **Impact**: Cannot analyze directly
- **Mitigation**: User provides structure via terminal commands
- **Status**: ⏳ Awaiting user input (TASK-1.1)

### ⚠️ Risk: Incomplete Keter Info
- **Scenario**: User provides minimal info or keter doesn't exist
- **Impact**: Analysis would be generic, decision tentative
- **Mitigation**: Design.md includes "analysis without access" strategy
- **Contingency**: Focus on generic guidelines, use keter as hypothetical

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (TASK-1.1)
User needs to provide keter information:
```powershell
cd C:\proyectos\aleia-bereshit\apps\keter
tree /F > keter-structure.txt
Get-Content keter-structure.txt
Get-Content requirements.txt  # or pyproject.toml
Get-Content README.md  # or PROPOSITO.md
```

### Once Info Received (TASK-1.2-1.3)
1. Analyze keter structure
2. Generate scorecard
3. Apply decision tree
4. Create preliminary recommendation

### Parallel Work (if user delayed)
Can proceed with REQ-2 to REQ-6 (documentation tasks) which are keter-agnostic:
- ADR-002 (general multi-repo strategy)
- Decision tree guidelines
- Repo template
- Multi-repo workflow guidelines

| Requirements Defined | 7 | 7 ✅ |
| Tasks Created | 18 | 18 ✅ |
| Folder Structure | Complete | Complete ✅ |
| Sequential Thinking Depth | 10+ thoughts | 12 ✅ |

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
- **Sequential Thinking MCP**: Excellent for complex architectural analysis
- **Phased Approach**: Breaking into discovery/documentation/cleanup/finalization logical
- **Multi-Repo Tags**: `[REPO:name]` convention clear and useful
- **Template Reuse**: Copied structure from monorepo-improvements-v1.1.0 spec

### Challenges
- **External Access**: Keter being outside workspace requires user collaboration
- **Scope Balance**: Had to consciously limit to strategic (not tactical implementation)
- **Abstraction Level**: Design.md needed pseudo-code but not actual implementation

### Improvements for Next Spec
- Start with "can we access all needed resources?" check
- Consider offering "lite" vs "full" spec options based on complexity
- Pre-define multi-repo conventions in global guidelines (then reference)
