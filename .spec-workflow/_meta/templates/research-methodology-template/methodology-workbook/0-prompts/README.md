## Purpose

This folder contains the initial prompts, context, and scope definitions that initiated the methodology research workbook.

## Files to Create

### prompt-initial.md
Document the initial prompt that started this research:
- Original question or problem statement
- Research objectives
- Expected outcomes

### context.md
Provide comprehensive context:
- Why this methodology is being researched
- Current problem or need it addresses
- Target audience for methodology
- Scope boundaries (what's included, what's excluded)
- Success criteria for research completion

### scope.md (optional)
Detailed scope definition:
- In-scope topics
- Out-of-scope topics
- Assumptions
- Constraints
- Dependencies on other research

## Example Structure

```markdown
# Initial Research Prompt

## Question
How can we systematically research and document the {Methodology Name} methodology?

## Objectives
1. Understand foundational concepts
2. Document execution steps
3. Create executable framework
4. Enable knowledge transfer

## Expected Outcomes
- Complete SPECIFICATION.yaml with all methodology steps
- Visual workflows in 4-canvas/
- Atomic concept extractions in 2-extracts/
- Integration analysis in 5-analysis-connection/
```

## Tips

- Be specific about research goals
- Define measurable success criteria
- Document assumptions early
- Reference related work or previous research
- Include time constraints if applicable
